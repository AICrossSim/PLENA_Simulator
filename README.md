This repository contains the multi-level simulator system for **PLENA (Programmable Long-context Efficient Neural Accelerator)**.

## Overview

The PLENA Simulator provides three main components:

- **Transaction-level Simulator**: Models PLENA's architectural behavior at a high level, enabling rapid exploration of design choices, memory hierarchies, and long-context LLM inference workflows without the overhead of cycle-accurate RTL simulation.
- **Analytical Latency Model**: Provides fast estimation of PLENA's performance characteristics (TTFT, TPS) based on architectural parameters and instruction latencies for specified workloads.
- **Utilization Model**: Analyzes the utilization of the systolic array based on architectural parameters and instruction latencies, computing attainable vs theoretical FLOPS.

## Setup

There are two ways to get a working environment. **Option A (Nix)** runs directly
on your machine and is best for day-to-day development. **Option B (Docker)** wraps
the same Nix environment in a container for portable, reproducible builds when you
don't want to install Nix on the host.

### Option A — Nix (native)

**Prerequisites:**

- `nix` package manager (with flakes enabled)
- `direnv` for environment management

```bash
# Install direnv hook in your shell
echo 'eval "$(direnv hook bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Installation:**

```bash
# Allow direnv to load the environment
direnv allow

# Enter the development environment
nix develop

# Update git submodules
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

You are now in a shell with the full toolchain (Rust, Python 3.12, clang, cmake,
etc.) and can run any of the `just` commands below directly.

### Option B — Docker

The Docker image encapsulates the same Nix environment, so you only need Docker
installed (no Nix or direnv on the host). All commands are run from the repository
root. Your working tree is bind-mounted into the container at `/workspace`, so edits
on the host are picked up live.

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker Engine with the Compose plugin (`docker compose`)
- (Optional) NVIDIA Container Toolkit for CUDA support

**Build the image and open a shell:**

```bash
just docker-dev
# Equivalent to:
#   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml build dev
#   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d dev
#   docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec dev bash
```

Inside the container, initialize submodules once and build the Rust emulator binary
(persisted on the host via the bind mount, so this is a one-time step):

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
(cd transactional_emulator && cargo build --release)
```

**Run commands without an interactive shell:**

```bash
# Run any command in the dev environment
just docker-run bash -c "just latency llama-3.1-8b"

# Run a just target directly
just docker-test test-linear
```

**Common Docker commands** (see [`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md) for the full list):

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just docker-build-dev` | Build the development image |
| `just docker-dev` | Build, start, and enter the dev container |
| `just docker-run <cmd>` | Run a command in the dev environment |
| `just docker-test <target>` | Run a `just` target in Docker |
| `just docker-down` | Stop containers |
| `just docker-clean` | Remove containers and cached volumes |

**CUDA support:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml --profile cuda up -d dev-cuda
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec dev-cuda bash
```

> **Note:** The repository is bind-mounted from the host (owned by your host user)
> while the container runs as `root`. The image marks `/workspace` as a git
> `safe.directory` so Nix's flake evaluation doesn't fail with a dubious-ownership
> error. If you build a custom image, preserve that setting.

## Configuration

The simulator and emulator both use `plena_settings.toml` as the main configuration file for hardware parameters. This file contains:

- Hardware dimensions (MLEN, BLEN, VLEN, HLEN)
- Memory configuration (HBM, SRAM sizes)
- Instruction latencies
- Prefetch/writeback amounts

The configuration file supports two modes:
- `analytic`: Used by analytical models (latency and utilization)
- `transactional`: Used by the transaction-level emulator

Set the active mode in the `[MODE]` section of `plena_settings.toml`.

---

## Transaction-level Emulation

The transaction-level emulator executes machine code instructions sequentially, modeling PLENA's behavior at a high abstraction level. It includes:

- HBM/DRAM off-chip memory simulation
- Handwritten assembly templates for every operator in PLENA ISA for LLaMA
- Test scripts to verify correctness of assembly templates

The emulator reads hardware configuration from `plena_settings.toml` (using the `behavior` mode).

### Running Simulations

**Standard mode:**
```bash
just build-emulator [task]
# Example: just build-behave-sim linear
```

**Debug mode:**
```bash
just build-emulator-debug [task]
# Example: just build-behave-sim-debug linear
```

**Run pre-generated assembly:**
```bash
just run-generated-asm
```

**Quiet mode (latency and error metrics only):**
```bash
just run-generated-asm-quiet
```

---

## Analytical Models

### Latency Model

The latency model provides fast performance estimation for PLENA workloads. It computes:
- **TTFT (Time To First Token)**: Latency for the prefill phase
- **TPS (Tokens Per Second)**: Throughput for the decode phase

#### Available Commands

**List available models:**
```bash
just latency-list-models
```

**Run with default settings** (llama-3.1-8b, batch=4, input=2048, output=1024):
```bash
just latency llama-3.1-8b
```

**Run with custom batch size:**
```bash
just latency-batch llama-3.1-8b 8
```

**Run with full custom parameters:**
```bash
just latency-full llama-3.1-8b 4 2048 1024
# Format: just latency-full {model} {batch} {input_seq} {output_seq}
```

**Get JSON output:**
```bash
just latency-json llama-3.1-8b
```
